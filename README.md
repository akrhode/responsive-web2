# responsiveWeb2

<strong>Second project from Jonas Schmedtmann's course 'Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS'<strong>

<p>
By building this project for a fictitious online shop, I practiced styling a webpage according to common web design rules. I worked on:
-	styling fonts to create a good reading experience
-	adding colors to elements and texts in line with a chosen color scheme
-	adding, sizing, and styling SVG icons 
-	adding box shadows to card components
-	styling elements and images by changing the border radius
-	adjusting margins to create whitespace to enhance visual hierarchy
