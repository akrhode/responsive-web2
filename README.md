# responsiveWeb2

Second project from Jonas Schmedtmann's course 'Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS'

<p>
By building this project for a fictitious online shop, I practiced styling a webpage according to common web design rules. I worked on:
<ul>
    <li>styling fonts to create a good reading experience</li>
    <li> adding colors to elements and texts in line with a chosen color scheme</li>
    <li>adding, sizing, and styling SVG icons</li>
    <li>adding box shadows to card components</li>
    <li>styling elements and images by changing the border radius</li>
    <li>adjusting margins to create whitespace to enhance visual hierarchy</li>
</ul>
